    "### [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ca/):\n",
    "\n",
    "[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ca/) has easily become the go-to search engine for scientific literature and is a good place to start to find a specific paper easily. Unfortunately, it offers less advanced search options than the two options below.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a free search engine providing access to scholarly literature, including articles, books, conference proceedings, and theses. It is a popular tool for researchers, students, and academics, as it offers a simple and user-friendly interface for discovering and accessing a comprehensive library of scholarly literature across most, if not all, disciplines. It also offers features such as citation tracking and alerting, which allows users to monitor and track the impact of their own research, as well as the work of others in their field. While the impact is not something we should focus on too much, it helps to identify the seminal papers on a given topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "To work with Google Scholar, simply access the platform through the Google Scholar website or through their Google account. They can use the search bar to enter keywords and other search terms and then refine their results using the various filters available. Users can also set up alerts to be notified when new articles or publications related to their areas of interest become available.\n",
    "\n",
    "google_scholar.png\n",
    "\n",
    "Google Scholar generally provides links to full-text articles, when available, as well as other related resources, such as author profiles and citation metrics. It adds some additional functionality for the specific search results:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clicking on the \"All versions\" keyword below a search result link will help you identify other versions of the paper if, e.g., the first source is paywalled. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Via the \"Cite\" keyword, you can also easily get a quick citation in a reference style of your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Clicking on the `3 Bars` in the top right, next to the search bar, reveals the Scholar menu. Here, you can select advanced search, which will open a pop-up looking like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "scholar_advanced.png\n",
    "\n",
    "It's pretty self-explanatory, but it allows you to match phrases either in the title or text, exclude phrases, and filter by author, publication, and year range.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advanced menu also allows you to set up E-mail notifications should new literature related to your field of interest be published. To set notifications, expand the menu on the top left, click on `Alerts,` click the `Create Alert` button, and enter your search criteria, as well as an e-mail address.\n",
    "\n",
    "To remove an alert, simply move to the alters menu as above and click the `Cancel` link behind the alert.\n",
    "\n",
    "created_alert.png\n",
    "\n",

    "## Basic search strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two basic strategies one can follow when searching for relevant literature: the `forward search using keywords/phrases ' or the `backward search following the references from a specific paper.` Backward search can also involve ` reverse footnote mining/citation search,` i.e., searching for other sources that have cited a particular article.\n",
    "\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "----------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Forward search`\n",
    "\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "`Keyword search`:\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply input a keyword of interest into the search bar of your engine of choice. The search engine will look for exact matches of this word in the title or body of a text. Using Google Scholar, if you just want to look for keywords in the title, use `in title: Keyword,` and if you are looking for keywords in the text body, use `intext: Keyword.`\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "`Logical operators`\n",
    "\n",
    "Keywords can additionally be refined using so-called `Boolean or logical operators`. These operators allow us to include or exclude certain keywords or to search for multiple keywords at once. The operator `AND` is already present in most search engines, meaning that if you simply write out three keywords separated by a space, the search engine will look for `Keyword1, ' ' Keyword2, ' and' Keyword3`. \n",
    "\n",
    "`NOT`: Excludes a certain term from a search query. Use a `-` sign to use this in, e.g., Google Scholar. -> `Keyword1 -Keyword2`\n",
    "\n",
    "`OR`: Finds one or either keywords included in a search query. -> `Keyword1 OR Keyword2` \n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "`Phrase search`\n",
    "\n",
    "A phrase search is a search query that looks for exact matches of a specific phrase rather than just individual keywords. It is useful when you want to find specific information that includes a particular sequence of words, such as a book title, a famous quote, or a specific concept, such as \"attachment theory.\" By using a phrase search, you can narrow down your search results and find information more relevant to your query.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when searching for information on attachment theory, using a keyword search such as `attachment` or simply  `attachment theory ' alone may yield a large number of search results that are not directly related to the specific psychological construct. However, by using a phrase search for `\"attachment theory,\"` it is more likely that the search results will be more targeted and relevant to the specific topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "To search for a specific phrase in Google Scholar, simply enclose the phrase in quotation marks `\" \".`\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "`Proximity search`\n",
    "\n",
    "A proximity search is a search query that looks for two or more words that appear close to each other in a document. This is useful when you are looking for information that relates to a specific context or topic and you want to find documents where these words appear together in close proximity. By using a proximity search, you can refine your search results and find more relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Google Scholar, this is done by using the `AROUND` operator and specifying how large the proximity between two keywords or phrases should be, e.g., if your two keywords should be no more than three words apart, write `Keyword1 AROUND (3) Keyword2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "`Truncation`\n",
    "\n",
    "Most academic databases allow us to look for related words to a specific search query using `truncation,` i.e., we can look for the terms psychologist/psychological/psychologically/ by inputting the keyword `psychology` and a `truncation symbol` usually an `asterisk *` `or a question mark.` \n",
    "\n",
    "Google Scholar does this per default using `automatic stemming,` meaning it looks for the specific keyword plus every word that can be built from the keyword when adding additional letters to the end of that word. For other search engines, you'll need to find the specific truncation symbol in use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scholar also searches for synonyms related to the words in your search strategy automatically, so searches for `psychology` will also include the term `psychology.` If you want to exclude a specific word from this behavior, either use the `NOT` operator or put your search term in quotation marks `\". \"`\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "`Nesting`:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, we combine all the above-mentioned strategies into our search queries. This is done via `nesting`. \n",
    "\n",
    "If I, for example, would be looking for psychological intervention for specific mood disorders separately but want to exclude bipolar disorder, I could use the following combination: \n",
    "\n",
    "`\"psychological intervention\" AND (Dysthymia OR dysthymic disorder OR Depression OR depressive disorder) NOT (bipolar)`\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Backward search`\n",
    "\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, a backward search can be performed in the same way as the forward searches above, but instead of looking for general keywords, we include excerpts from the cited literature of a specific paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll be generally successful using either the `title of the cited paper` in question or its `Digital Object Identifier (DOI).` You could also search for more literature from the author of the paper in question by using the `author: authorname` operator in Google Scholar or by clicking on an author name in the search results on Google Scholar.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're interested in what, e.g., newer papers have cited a paper, you can find this information via `reverse footnote mining/citation search.`\n",

    "\n",
    "After identifying all relevant studies on a given topic, it's necessary to screen the abstracts, full text, and citations of the studies in question.\n",
    "\n",
    "The screening process involves the creation of screening tools and applying them to different aspects of the selected literature. \n",
    "\n",
    "First is the creation of a screening tool/strategy to filter study abstracts and titles for ineligible articles such as essays or non-empirical studies. This helps you organize and sort the abstracts based on how likely it is that they should be included in your review.\n",
    "\n",
    "The screening tool consists of a checklist of multiple clear and concise questions that lead to the inclusion or exclusion of a study.\n",
    "Following Polaning et al. (2019), The questions/ items should be \n",
    "\n",
    "    * (a) objective, \n",
    "    * (b) “single-barreled, i.e., only related to a single aspect of the abstract: E.g., “Does the abstract indicate that participants were sampled from the general population?”\n",
    "    * (c) use the same sentence structure,\n",
    "    * (d) include yes/no/unsure answers only\n",
    "     \n",
    "\n",
    "This process can include free text-mining software like [Abstrackr](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2110363.2110464) (Wallace et al., 2012).\n",

    "* [Center for Evidence Synthesis in Health: Introduction to Abstract (Youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxKaJF0dgJ0)\n",
    "\n",
    "**After completing the title and abstract screening, gather all the included full-text PDFs. This step is commonly called retrieval.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The full-text screening process is similar to the abstract screening process and involves the following steps:\n",
    "    * Developing a screening tool\n",
    "    * Screening each article\n",
    "    * Making a decision about whether it should be included\n",
    "    \n",
    "The questions in your screening tool should be informed by your research question and can include topics such as the methods used or the sampled population. Unfortunately, there is no validated, dependable text-mining tool to assist with the full-text screening process at the moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting collection of studies should then be a solid base for future research. An easy way to keep track of the literature in question is to add them to a citation manager such as [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/). A so-created Zotero library can be used to create a list of references on the fly, shared online, or integrated with a number of other digital tools.

    "Of course, an essential part of evaluating literature is evaluating the quality of a paper itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Some overall tips would be:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, skim the article and identify its structure\n",
    "2. Distinguish main points/graphs\n",
    "3. Take notes/annotate along the way\n",
    "4. Read carefully and re-evaluate your annotations\n",

    "The following is an in-depth guide on how to seriously engage with a scientific paper to gain the maximum information and benefit from it. This may seem discouraging due to the sheer scope of the task, but it's a great idea to train and ultimately automatize this process.\n",

    "\n",
    "Regarding the entire work, including all sections, ask yourself the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What do the author(s) want to know (motivation)? \n",
    "2. What did they do (approach/methods)? \n",
    "3. Why was it done that way (context within the field)? \n",
    "4. What do the results show (figures and data tables)? \n",
    "5. How did the author(s) interpret the results (interpretation/discussion)? \n",
    "6. What should be done next?\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, it's not necessary to engage this deeply with every paper you come across. Don't waste your time on papers that don't relate to what you want to find out. In this case, concentrate on the first three steps presented below to evaluate the worth of a given paper for your work.\n",

    "## Finding data\n",
    "\n",
    "Gregory et al. (2018) provide [Eleven Quick Tips for Finding Research Data”](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006038). Well, go through the most important tips in the following section and list some considerations of our own, but for more in-depth info, check out the paper itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Tip 1`: Think about the data you need and why you need them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluate whether you seek data as the basis for a new study, for comparison or validation with existing results/data, or to simply explore or simulate the behavior or characteristics of certain types of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, make a list of the characteristics your data should fulfill for the above-identified purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements could include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* task/process or subject in question\n",
    "* data format (e.g., behavioral, questionnaire, EEG, fMRI, etc.)\n",
    "* spatial or temporal coverage (location/region and year or age range, etc.)\n",
    "* availability (free, \"upon request\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Tip 2`: Select the most appropriate resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "While you can find data available online, e.g., in:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Open Science Repositories`: Repositories such as OSF, OpenNeuro, the OpenfMRI database, and the IEEE DataPort provide open access to MRI and EEG datasets, as well as other neuroimaging data.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Research Data Repositories`: [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org), Figshare, and other research data repositories allow scientists to store, share, and publish their data in an open and transparent manner. These repositories are often committed to open access principles and provide a centralized location for data and metadata, as well as version control and preservation features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or explore databases specific to your field of study:\n",
    "For neuroscience, the most prominent would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Neuroscience Information Network](https://neuinfo.org//)\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Openneuro](https://openneuro.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can further consult `research data search engines`:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Research data search engines` help researchers discover and access (ideally high-quality) data repositories across different scientific disciplines.\n",
    "\n",
    "One such service is [FAIRsharing](https://fairsharing.org/):\n",
    "\n",
    "Fairsharing platform aims to promote the principles of Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) in research data management by providing a curated collection of resources that comply with these standards. With FAIRsharing, researchers can search for datasets, ontologies, and other research resources based on their scientific domain, data type, and other relevant parameters. By facilitating the discovery and reuse of research data, FAIRsharing aims to foster collaboration, accelerate scientific progress, and maximize the impact of research outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other `research data search engines` are, for example: \n",
    "\n",
    "* [Registry of research data repositories: re3data](https://www.re3data.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Google: datasetsearch](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Dryad](http://datadryad.org)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A good starting point to find databases and search engines for your field of study is the constantly updated Wikipedia [List of academic databases and search engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_databases_and_search_engines) and [List of online databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_online_databases).\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Tip 3`: Construct your query strategically.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same strategies as for literature search apply; make sure to explore multiple combinations of search terms and operators during your search and `document every search query.` Additionally, use multiple search engines/databases and tailor your search queries and vocabulary for each individual database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Tip 4`: Make the repository work for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make yourself familiar with the platform and investigate further resources on how to best work with the search engine/database. For example, follow the [Openneuro User Guide](https://docs.openneuro.org/user_guide.html) to make the most out of the platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Tip 5`: Refine your search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rerun your search and investigate different approaches if you don't find any relevant datasets. \n",
    "Look for datasets that may be close to what you are looking for and look through their additional information, e.g., the authors, working group location, or relevant keywords, and refine your search based on this information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Tip 6`: Assess data relevance and fitness -for -use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-reference with the requirements provided in Tip 1. Also, evaluate the data format (e.g., the [BIDS]() standard] and check the quality parameters that most platforms include. If a dataset looks fit for your purposes, investigate further by downloading samples and implementing your own systematic quality assessment or analyzing the descriptive statistics provided with the dataset. This is not a trivial task, so make sure to search for relevant tools and papers on the subject and consult with your colleagues or advisors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Tip 7`: Save your search and data source details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation!! Record your search queries, ideally on which date you searched, as well as the name of the dataset in question and its persistent identifier (digital object identifier (DOI); Global et al. (GUID).\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Tip 8`: Look for data services, not just data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data may not necessarily be available without using a specific service and can only be accessed via an application programming interface (API). \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of such services include for example: \n",
    "\n",
    "[NSW Climate Data Portal](http://climatechange.environment.nsw.gov.au/Climate-projections-for-NSW/Download-datasets)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Amazon Web Services (AWS) public datasets](https://aws.amazon.com/public-datasets/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Tip 9`: Monitor the latest data.\n",
    "\n",
    "New publications have, at times, the requirement to host their data on public platforms; some platforms provide the ability to set keyword-based e-mail alarms to keep you up to date. Otherwise, monitor recent publications (e.g., as shown above for Google Scholar) and check back with the databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Tip 10`: Treat sensitive data responsibly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This speaks for itself; most data that you'll find online is anonymized and cleared for the public, but if you ever work with data from colleagues or collect your own data, you are required to apply to local data protection laws, especially when dealing with identifiable data of human subjects, for more info see our [Lecture on data management](https://diler-digitell.github.io/DiLER_digital_literacy_course/content/data_management.html) .\n",
    "### `Tip 11`: Give back (cite and share data).\n",
    "\n",
    "`Attribute`: Identify how the authors of a dataset would like to be cited and apply this standard wherever possible\n",
    "\n",
    "`Give Feedback`: Offer input to the creators of the data or the data repository regarding any problems related to the accessibility of the data, the quality of the data, or the completeness and interpretability of metadata (i.e., data describing the dataset, such as descriptive population statistics).\n",
    "\n",
    "`Make your own data open & accessible`: For a guide on how to best do that, see our [Lecture on data management](https://diler-digitell.github.io/DiLER_digital_literacy_course/content/data_management.html) .\n",
