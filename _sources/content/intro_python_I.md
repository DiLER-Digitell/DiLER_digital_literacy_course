# Intro to Python


The big moment is finally here: after spending quite a bit of time exploring important concepts adjacent to/around `Python`, with the intention to provide a holistic understanding and situate components accordingly, we will start exploring `Python` itself. 

Within the [first block](https://m-earnest.github.io/diler_dgitial_literacy_course/content/intro_python_nb_I.html) of programming with `Python` we will go through basics of the `Python` programming language, its central aspects and building blocks, as well as its benefits generally speaking and within the context of psychology research.

Within the [second block](https://m-earnest.github.io/diler_dgitial_literacy_course/content/intro_python_nb_II.html) we'll be learning about the usage and roles of logical operators and data structures in `Python`.

In the [last Block](https://m-earnest.github.io/diler_dgitial_literacy_course/content/intro_python_nb_III.html) we'll learning how to connect separate lines of `Python` code, i.e. controling the flow of a Python program using `Loops` and `conditional statements`. We'll further learn how and why to write functions in `Python`.
