    "\n",
    "Writing a scientific paper can be a challenging task, but with a well-structured approach and a few helpful tips, it can be a rewarding experience. A scientific paper is a formal way to communicate your research findings to the scientific community and is an essential part of the scientific process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a typical structure for a scientific paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Introduction: Provide background information and the purpose of the study. State the research question and explain why it is important.\n",
    "2. Methods: Describe the methods and procedures used in the experiment, including any equipment and materials used.\n",
    "3. Results: Present your findings, including any data and statistical analyses. Use tables, figures, and graphs to help illustrate the results.\n",
    "4. Discussion: Interpret the results and discuss their implications. Compare your results with previous research and suggest future directions for research.\n",
    "5. Conclusion: Summarize the main findings and their significance.\n",
    "6. References: List the sources cited in the paper in a consistent format (e.g. APA, MLA).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach can be futrher adapted to structured reports, but make sure to check back on the specfics of your individual assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tips for Junior Scientists:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Be concise and to the point. Avoid unnecessary words/phrases.\n",
    "- Use clear and simple language. Avoid technical phrases unless necessary\n",
    "- Be thorough and accurate in reporting your results. Include all relevant data and any limitations (better to cut later than to have to redo the work, because you missed important implications)\n",
    "- Support your claims and conclusions with references, as much as possible\n",
    "- Review and revise your work several times before submitting it. Pay attention to grammar, spelling, and formatting.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Google Docs is a free, web-based word processing program that allows users to create and edit text documents, spreadsheets, and presentations in real-time from anywhere with an internet connection. It is part of the Google Workspace suite of productivity tools and is widely used for collaborative work among teams and organizations. In this chapter, we will discuss how to use Google Docs, its benefits for collaborative work, and some of its key features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Getting Started with Google Docs\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of you should already have an google account, e.g. if you're using gmail or youtube.

    "- new_button.png\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also upload existing documents from your computer or import by selecting \"upload file\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why use Google docs?\n",
    "\n",
    "The key features google docs offers are collaborative Editing, an integrated version history, as well as a number of templates and Add-ons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Features of Google Docs\n",
    "\n",
    "    Collaborative Editing: Google Docs allows multiple users to edit the same document in real-time, making it easy for teams to work together on a project. You can invite people to view, comment, or edit a document, and see who is making changes in real-time.\n",

    "\n",
    "    Increased Productivity: Google Docs’ version history and commenting system make it easier for teams to keep track of changes, provide feedback, and make decisions, leading to increased productivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Improved Communication: Google Docs’ commenting system allows team members to communicate directly within a document, improving the flow of communication and reducing the need for separate email exchanges.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Add-Ons for google docs:\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding new extensions to google docs is trivial, simply click on `Extensions` -> `Add ons` -> `Get add-ons` and use the search bar to find new add-ons. Alternatively, some tools offer browser-based solution, simpyl follow the installation tutorials provided on the following selction of examples.\n",

    "### Other Academic content\n",
    "\n",
    "But academic content can take on many forms beside the classic report or thesis paper, especially now that it's become easier than ever to create an online presence a community of scientists is switching to creating websites documenting their research endeavours in-depth, often alongside classic journal publications.\n",
    "\n",
    "These \"living publications\" often take the form of an e-book that is freely accessible online. An example of this can be found here for the [publication “Neuroscout: a unified platform for generalizable and reproducible fMRI research”](https://neuroscout.github.io/neuroscout-paper/intro.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the chapter [communication and collaboration]() you'll learn how to create such an online presence. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating/Maintaining a Lab-notbebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying content is often derived from the documentation scientists write alongside their scientific work. A usefull tool to take notes and document your work is a so called \"lab notebook\". \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting into the habit of maintaing a lab notebook is crucial for beginner scientists, regardless of their field of study, but is also a relevant skill for every professional.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a tool to record all of your observations, measurements, calculations, and ideas related to a scientific experiment or project. A well-kept lab notebook serves as a permanent record of your work and can be a valuable resource for future reference, collaboration, and communication with others. Storing it online, e.g. on a project [repository on GitHub]() allows you to access your notes from anywhere in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Your Lab Notebook May either be project specfifc or may be kept more in the form of a \"research diary\", were you jot down what you've been working on throught a day or week.\n",
    "\n",
    "Content could be:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Date and title of the experiment, project or sub-task that you've been working on\n",
    "    Background information and purpose, links or snippets of relevant literature\n",
    "    Code and related bugs you may have encountered, including how you've solved them\n",
    "    Procedure, including step-by-step instructions and any deviations from the plan\n",
    "    Observations, including data and measurements recorded during the experiment\n",
    "    Calculations, including formulas and results\n",
    "    Drawings, Graphs and visual aids\n",
    "    Questions that came up during your work\n",
    "    Problems you may have encountered\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "How often you update and how extensive your entries are, are entirely up to you. A good habit is to take short notes at the end of each workday and translate them into your Lab notebook once a week. This not only helps you keep tabs on the work you've been doing, but also helps you to more deeply think about and engage with your work. It further provides a handy ressource for progress meetings with other students or Professors and P.I.s \n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "A popular file format for writing a lab-notebook and for scientific content creation is the [Jupyter Notebook](link), as it provides a convenient and interactive environment for data analysis, visualization, and presentation. With Jupyter, you can mix code, text, mathematical equations, and multimedia in one document, making it an ideal tool for researchers, data scientists, and students alike. Jupyter supports multiple programming languages, including Python, R, and Julia, and it is easy to share and collaborate with others on your work. \n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you're taking notes and collecting code snippets in your lab-notebook, or writing a report, research paper, Jupyter Notebooks can help you organize and communicate your findings effectively.\n",
