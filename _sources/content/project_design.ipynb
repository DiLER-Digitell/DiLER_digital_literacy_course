The first step of every project should therefore involve turning our observations/thoughts into a well defined research question. Start of by [scouring literature](lit_review) and find out more about the topic. \n",

    "\n",
    "A `quantitative research question` can be answered using numerical data and statistical analysis. They generally appear in 3 different forms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- descriptive: describe a phenomenon or group of people in detail (e.g. what is the prevalence of depression in hamsters?)\n",
    "\n",
    "- comparative: compare two or more groups or phenomena (\"What are the differences in academic performance between students from academic and blue collar families?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- `relationship`s: how do changes in one variable affect changes in another (\"What is the relationship between social media use and the prevalence of eating disorders in teenagers?\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "A `qualitative research question` focuses more on exploring and understanding e.g. social phenomena, experiences, and perspectives in-depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "- They may be `open-ended`, allowing the researcher to explore the phenomenon in-depth. For example, \"What factors contribute to the success of mentoring programs in the workplace?\". \n",
    "\n",
    "- They also may `seek to explore exeriences, or perspectives`, e.g. \"What is the experience of living with chronic illness?\" or `seek to explore processes`, such as how something happens or how people make meaning of their experiences, e.g. \"How do parents navigate the challenges of raising a child with autism?\" or \"What are the processes involved in the formation of a group identity among adolescents?\n",
    "\n",
    "- They may further be `concerned with a description/exploration of the nature a specific context`, such as a culture, community, organization, or group of individuals.
