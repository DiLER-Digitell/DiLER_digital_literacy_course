    "\n",
    "It involves understanding `how information is produced, distributed, and consumed`, and being able to `identify credible sources and assess the quality of information`. In today's digital age, where information is easily accessible and widely available, it's crucial for individuals to have strong information and media literacy skills to navigate the vast amount of information and media available. This knowledge will not only help you make informed decisions but also help you effectively participate in the world of academia. In the following lessons, we will explore the fundamental concepts and skills of information & media literacy, helping you become a more informed and discerning user of digital information and media.\n",
