    "Academic content can take on many forms beside the classic report or thesis paper, especially now that it's become easier than ever to create an online presence a community of scientists is switching to creating websites documenting their research endeavours in-depth, often alongside classic journal publications.\n",
    "\n",
    "These \"living publications\" often take the form of an e-book that is freely accessible online. An example of this can be found here for the [publication “Neuroscout: a unified platform for generalizable and reproducible fMRI research”](https://neuroscout.github.io/neuroscout-paper/intro.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the chapter [communication and collaboration]() you'll learn how to create such an online presence. An in-dept intoduction how to create a website using open-source tools can be found in the course [ creating interactive content with “Jupyter Books”!](https://felixkoerber.github.io/jb/intro.html), this template can be simply adapted to host a book or publication.\n",

    "The underlying content is often derived from the documentation scientists write alongside their scientific work. A usefull tool to take notes and document your work is a so called \"lab notebook\". \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting into the habit of maintaing a lab notebook is crucial for beginner scientists, regardless of their field of study, but is also a relevant skill for every professional.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a tool to record all of your observations, measurements, calculations, and ideas related to a scientific experiment or project. A well-kept lab notebook serves as a permanent record of your work and can be a valuable resource for future reference, collaboration, and communication with others. Storing it online, e.g. on a project [repository on GitHub]() allows you to access your notes from anywhere in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Your Lab Notebook May either be project specfifc or may be kept more in the form of a \"research diary\", were you jot down what you've been working on throught a day or week.\n",

    "\n",
    "How often you update and how extensive your entries are, is entirely up to you. A good habit is to take short notes at the end of each workday and translate them into your Lab notebook once a week. This not only helps you keep tabs on the work you've been doing, but also helps you to more deeply think about and engage with your work. It further provides a handy ressource for progress meetings with other students or Professors and P.I.s \n",
