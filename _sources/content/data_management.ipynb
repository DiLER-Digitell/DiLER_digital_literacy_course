    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation?\n",
    "\n",
    "For the public good\n",
    "- if widely adopted makes it inherently more easier to reproduce code and anylsis pipelines build by others, therefore lowering scientific waste and improving efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "For yourself\n",

    "- You are likely the future user of the data and data analysis pipelines you’ve developed, so keeping your file structure standarized removes the need to remember where you've stored specific pieces of data etc.\n",

    "Now while having a standarized data format on our system, let's turn towards the topic of data storage. While for small projects or purely behavioral research your local file system may seem initially sufficient, for larger datasets and file sizes, such as in neuroimaging, you'll quickly run out of storage. The same applies when you collect a larger number of smaller projects throughtout your career, of course. Further, do we really want to store data simply on some laptop until it is forgotten/deleted and in general inaccessible to others who might make use of it?\n",
