    "## What is \"Digital Literacy\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "A straightforward definition of digital literacy usually involves the ability to independently find, evaluate, communicate, and handle information from digital media (Shopova 2014).\n",
    "\n",
    "That the lack of digital literacy can limit social integration and personal growth, making it a crucial life skill to possess (Shapiro, 2009) was already true more than a decade ago, as more and more of our everyday life drifts into virtual spaces, it becomes an absolute necessity to be digitally literate. This is especially true for people in academia and research, as every step of our academic career and every step in the research process nowadays depends on finding, evaluating, and applying knowledge found online or on the application of digital tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of digital literacy is not to be underestimated as digital literacy in itself may be viewed simply as the current form of \"literacy per se\" in our culture - i.e., \"to read, write and otherwise deal with information using the technologies and formats of the time.\" (Bawden, 2008)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore the idea behind this ability a bit more closely. There have been many different understandings of what it means to be digitally literate over the last decades, including its definition and correlated implications (Bawden, 2008). The discourse can roughly be categorized into two positions. \n",
    "\n",
    "One position holds that digital literacy is primarily concerned with skills that must be acquired to be seen as digitally literate. In contrast, the other has that digital literacy focuses on the \"cognitive and socio-emotional aspects of working in a digital environment.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "For this course, we're not only leaning into the idea of digital literacy as a competence or a generalizable ability, following the initial proposition of \"mastering ideas, not keystrokes\" by Paul Glister (1997), but we will demonstrate the underlying concepts, such as how to \"find or handle information\", by discussing specific tools and how to use them properly. Therefore, demonstrating how these concepts relate to acquiring and possibly mastering a skill will make scientific work much easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "----------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "As this course is primarily centered around scientific practice, we will not be dealing with essential topics such as \"What is this Internet?\", \"What's a meme?\" or \"How do I use social media?\". These concepts are nevertheless important to mention as they illustrate why digital literacy is such an important concept - the “participation gap” - between those who can and those who can't maneuver digital spaces and handle digital tools to get ahead in life. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The \"participation gap\" this course tries to bridge is based on the differences between those who can effectively use digital tools and information to do scientific work and those who may not have the necessary knowledge yet.**\n",

    "**Improved data management:** Digital literacy helps students manage and preserve their research data in a manner that is accessible and transparent, allowing other researchers to verify and build upon their work.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Encourages transparency:** Digital literacy encourages students to make their research findings openly available and accessible to other researchers, which promotes transparency and accountability in science.

    "## Ethical and Social Implications of Digital Literacy for Participation in Academia and Research\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's further reflect on how our digital culture shapes the academic system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital technologies have revolutionized how information is collected, analyzed, and disseminated in academia and research. However, they have also raised new ethical and social issues, such as privacy and security, intellectual property, and the democratization of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Academia and research (you and I included) must consider these ethical and social implications when using digital technologies and work to minimize any negative impacts. This requires an adequate understanding and awareness of digital technologies, their capabilities, and how they shape the scientific process. In short, being digitally literate is essential for everyone involved in this system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, as researchers and academics, we are responsible for ensuring that our scientific output (which nowadays also usually includes digital technologies in the form of apps or code) promotes the public good and supports the ethical principles of our community. This includes protecting data privacy, ensuring unbiased research results, and promoting transparency and access to our results (usually funded through tax-payer money).\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, you'll find some of the problems emerging from a lack of integration of digital literacy into the academic system.\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "**Systemic barriers in academia:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unequal access to technology: the aforementioned \"participation gap\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "Students facing socio-economic hardships may be unable to afford the tools they've been trained on in university (think paid software such as Excel, Photoshop, and SPSS) or cannot afford the hardware to participate in research projects. This perpetuates economic and career-related inequalities, and it is our duty as members of society to remedy this flaw.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Inadequate funding for technology and training:**\n",
    "Many academic institutions have limited budgets for technology and training, which can prevent faculty and staff from acquiring the digital skills they need to succeed in the modern educational environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Outdated policies and procedures:**\n",
    "Academic institutions may have policies and procedures not designed to accommodate digital technologies, which can create barriers for faculty and students who want to use these tools in their work or depend on them for future endeavors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Lack of integration of digital tools into curricula:** \n",
    "Students may not receive adequate training in digital devices and technologies during their education, which they will require for their research projects or future Ph.D. positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Resistance to change:** \n",
    "Due to not understanding the necessity of digital skills in the sciences, some faculty members may be resistant to using digital technologies in their teaching, which can create barriers for students trying to develop their digital skills. (For example, why would a psychologist need to be able to code?)\n",
