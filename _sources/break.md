# Yoga and/or dance break

We all know the feeling: after sitting in a course for several hours, trying to follow and comprehend what's being shown and talked about, one just gets tired...Sure, coffee breaks are great and bring some energy back, and the usual chat with folks is great for relaxing and networking. However, during these things, we all tend not to move a lot, and this is actually what our bodies need and want: moving around and stretching to get that blood to circulate and pump up our oxygen levels. Thus, we advocate taking five dedicated minutes within each break to specifically get some physical activity. It could be walking around, yoga, dancing...whatever works for you and you feel comfortable with. Gotta stay healthy, y'all!
