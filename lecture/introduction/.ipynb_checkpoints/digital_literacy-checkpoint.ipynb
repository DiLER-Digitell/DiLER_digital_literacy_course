    "## What is \"digital literacy\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "A straightforward definition of digital literacy usually pertains to ones ability to independently find, evaluate, communicate, and handle information from digital media (Shopova 2014).\n",
    "\n",
    "That the lack of digital literacy can limit social integration and personal growth, making it a crucial life skill to possess (Shapiro, 2009) was already true more than a decade ago, nowadays as more and more of our everyday life drifts into virtual spaces it becomes an absolute necessity to be digital literate. This is especially true for people in academdia and research, as every step of our acadmic carreer and every step in the research process nowadays is dependent on finding, evaluating and applying knowledge found online or dependent in the application of digital tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of digital literacy is not to be underestimated as digital literacy in itself may be viewed simply as  the current form of \"literacy per se\" in our culture - i.e. \"to read, write and otherwise deal with information using the technologies and formats of the time\". (Bawden, 2008)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore the idea behind this ability a bit more closely. There's been quite a few different understandings what it means to be digital literacy over the last decades, each including their own definition and correlated implications (Bawden, 2008). The discourse can roughly be categorized into two positions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Where one position holds the idea that digital literacy is primarily concerned with a set of skills, that have to be aquired to be seen a as digitally literate, while the other holds the idea that digital literacy is focused on the \"cognitive and socio-emotional aspects of working in a digital environment\"\n",
    "\n",
    "For this course we're not only leaning into the idea of digital literacy as a competence or a generalizable ability, following the initial proposition of \"mastering ideas, not keystrokes\" by Paul Glister (1997), but we will demonstrate the underlying concepts, such as how to \"find or handle information\", by discussing specfific tools and how to properly use them. Therefore demonstrating how these concepts relate to the aquisition and possibly mastery of a skillset, that will make scientific work much easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As this course is primarily centered around scientific practice, we will not be dealing with basic topics such as \"What is this interenet?\", \"what's a meme?\" or \"how do i use social media?\". \n",
    "Although we can make a point of them, as they illustrate the basic point of why digital literacy is such an important concept, namely that there is  “participation gap”, between those who can and can't maneuver digital spaces and handle digital information. \n",
    "\n",
    "The \"participation gap\" this course tries to bridge is based on the differences between those that can effectively use digital tools and information to do scientific work and those who may not have the necessary knowledge yet.\n",

With these skills, students are better equipped to contribute to the advancement of science and help to promote the values of openness and collaboration in the scientific community.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some specific examples would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Increased access to data and information:** \n",
    "Digital literacy provides students with the skills they need to access and use large and complex data sets, which are essential for open science. With these skills, students are better equipped to collaborate with other researchers and contribute to the scientific community.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Better collaboration:** Digital literacy enables students to collaborate with researchers from around the world, regardless of location. This allows students to work on open science projects with a broader range of expertise and perspectives, leading to more informed and innovative research.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Improved data management:** Digital literacy helps students to manage and preserve their research data in a manner that is accessible and transparent, allowing other researchers to verify and build upon their work.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Encourages transparency:** Digital literacy encourages students to make their research findings openly available and accessible to other researchers, which promotes transparency and accountability in science. Learning about what it means for research to be FAIR(citation), meaning **F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable, and **R**eusable (regarding analyses and digital assets) will not only turn students into better scientists, but will magnify the impact of their research in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supports open access:** Digital literacy helps students to understand the importance of open access and the benefits it brings to the scientific community. By teaching students about open access, educators can help to ensure that future generations of scientists are committed to making their research openly available to all.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ethical and social implications of Digital literacy and their meaning for academia and research**\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"In academia and research, digital technologies have revolutionized the way information is collected, analyzed, and disseminated. However, they have also raised new ethical and social issues, such as privacy and security, intellectual property, and the democratization of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the widespread collection and storage of personal data by digital technologies has raised concerns about privacy and security, as well as the responsible use of this data by corporations and governments. Additionally, the ease of accessing and sharing information online has made it more difficult to protect intellectual property and ensure that original ideas are properly credited.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Systemic barriers in academia:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Unequal access to technology: the aforementioned \"participation gap\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Students facing socio-economic hardships may not be able to afford the tools they've been trained on in university (think paid software such as Excel, Photoshop, SPSS) or are unable to afford the hardware to participate in research projects. This perpetuates enonomic and career related inequalities and it is our duty as members of society to remedy this flaw.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. Inadequate funding for technology and training: \n",
    "Many academic institutions have limited budgets for technology and training, which can prevent faculty and staff from acquiring the digital skills they need to succeed in the modern academic environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Outdated policies and procedures: \n",
    "Academic institutions may have policies and procedures that are not designed to accommodate the use of digital technologies, which can create barriers for faculty and students who want to use these tools in their work or depend on them for future endevaours.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Lack of integration of digital tools into curricula: \n",
    "Students may not receive adequate training in digital tools and technologies during their education, that they will require for their own research projects or future phd positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Resistance to change: \n",
    "Due to not understanding the necessity of digital skills in the sciences, some faculty members may be resistant to the use of digital technologies in their teaching, which can create barriers for students who are trying to develop their digital skills. (E.g why would a psychologist need to be able to code?)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Inadequate support: \n",
    "There may be a lack of support for faculty members who are trying to integrate digital tools into their teaching, including inadequate training and resources \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Academia and research (you and me included) must consider these ethical and social implications when using digital technologies and must work to minimize any negative impacts. This requires an adequate understanding and awareness of digital technologies, their capabilities and the way they shape the scientif process. Digital literacy is therefore an essential abilitys for everonye involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, we, as researchers and academics have a responsibility to ensure that the our scientific output (which nowadays also usually includes  digital technologies in the form of apps or code) promotes the public good and supports the ethical principles our community.
