It also offers features such as citation tracking and alerting, which allows users to monitor and track the impact of their own research, as well as the work of others in their field. While impact is not something we should focus on too much, it helps identifying the seminal papers on a given topic.\n",

    "### Basic search strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two basic strategies one can follow when searching for relevant literature, the `forward search using keywords/phrases`or the `backward search following the refernces from a specific paper`. Backwards search can also involve ` reverse footnote mining/citation search`, i.e. searching for other sources that have cited a particular article.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Forward search`\n",
    "\n",
    "`Keyword search`:\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply input a keyword of interest into the search bar of your sengine of choice. The seaerch engine will following look for exact matches of this word in the title or body of a text. Using google scholar if you just want to look for keywords in the title use `intitle: Keyword` and if your looking for keyowrds in the text body use `intext: Keyword`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Logical operators`\n",
    "\n",
    "Keywords can additionaly be refined using so called `Boolean or logical operators`. These operators allow us to include or exclude certain keywords or to search for multiple keywords at once. The operator `AND` is already preset in most search engines, meaning that if you simply write out 3 keywords separated by a space the search engine will look for `Keyword1 and Keyword2 and Keyword3`. \n",
    "\n",
    "`NOT`: Excludes a certain term from a search query. Use a `-`sign to use this in e.g. google scholar. -> `Keyword1 -Keyword2`\n",
    "\n",
    "`OR`: Finds one or either keywords included in a search query. -> `Keyword1 OR Keyword2` \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`Phrase search`\n",
    "\n",
    "A phrase search is a search query that looks for exact matches of a specific phrase rather than just individual keywords. It is useful when you want to find specific information that includes a particular sequence of words, such as a book title, a famous quote or a specific concept such as \"attachment theory\". By using a phrase search, you can narrow down your search results and find information more relevant to your query.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example when searching for information on attachment theory, using a keyword search such as `attachment` or simply  `attachment theory`alone may yield a large number of search results that are not directly related to the specific psychological construct. However, by using a phrase search for `\"attachment theory\"`, it is more likely that the search results will be more targeted and relevant to the specific topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "To search for a specific phrase in google scholar simply enclose the phrase in quotation marks `\" \"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`Proximity search`\n",
    "\n",
    "A proximity search is a search query that looks for two or more words that appear close to each other in a document. This is useful when you are looking for information that relates to a specific context or topic, and you want to find documents where these words appear together in close proximity. By using a proximity search, you can refine your search results and find more relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In google scholar this is done by using the `AROUND` operator and specifying how large the proximity between two keywords or phrases should be, e.g. if your two keywords should be no more than 3 words apart write `Keyword1 AROUND (3) Keyword2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`Truncation`\n",
    "\n",
    "Most academic databases allow us to look for related words to a spefic search query using `truncation`, i.e we can look for for the terms psychologist/psychological/psychologically/ by inputing the keyword `psychologi` and a `truncation symbol` usually an `asterisk *` `or a question mark`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Google scholar does this per default using `automatic stemming`, meaning it looks for the specific keyword plus every word that can be build from the keyword when adding additional letters to the end of that word. For other search engines you'll need to find the speific truncation symbol in use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scholar also searches for synonyms related to the words in your search strategy automatically, so searches for `psychologi` will also include the term `psychology`. If you want to exclude a specific word from this behaviour either use the `NOT` operatore or put your search term in quotation marks `\" \"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Nesting`:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally we combine all the above mentioned strategies into our search queries. This is done via `nesting`. \n",
    "\n",
    "If i for example would be looking for a psychological intervention for sepcific mood disorders separately, but want to exclude bipolar disorder, i coulde use the following combination: \n",
    "\n",
    "`\"psychological intervention\" AND (Dysthymia OR dysthmic disorder OR Depression OR depressive disorder) NOT (bipolar)`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Backward search`\n",
    "\n",
    "In general a backward search can be performed in the same way as the forward searches above, but instead of looking for general keywords we include excerpts from the cited literature of a specific paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll be generally sucessfull using either the `title of the cited paper` in question or it's `Digital Object Identifier (doi)`. You could also search for more literature from the author of the paper in question by using the `author: authorname` operator in google scholar or by clicking on an authors name in the search results on google scholar.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're interested in what e.g. newer papers have cited a paper of you can find this information via `reverse footnote mining/citation search`.\n",

    "Terms and Phrases need to be sensitive enough to capture all relevant studies, meaning that e.g. the terms used capture as much as possible of the studies relevant to the topic. \n",
    "In literature search it's recommended to tailor your search terms/syntax to maximizie sensitivity (proportion of studies identified divided to total number of relevant studies in existence)  while being prepared to accept low precision (the proportion of relevant studies to the total number of studies identified) (Higgins et al., 2022). This is necessary as an increase in sensitivity will naturally lead to a reduction in precision,\n",

    "\n",
    "After identifying all relevant studies on a given topic, it's necessary to screen the abstracts, full-text and citations of the studies in question.\n",
    "\n",
    "The screening processs involves the creation of a screening tools and following applying them to different apects of the selected literature. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, is the creation of a screening tool/strategy to filter study abstracts and titles for ineligible articles such as essays or non-empirical studies. This helps you organize and sort the abstracts based on how likely it is that they should be included in your review.\n",
    "\n",
    "The screening tool consists of a check-list of multiple clear and concise questions that lead to inclusion or exclusion of a study.\n",
    "Following Polaning et al. (2019) The questions/ items should be \n",
    "\n",
    "    * (a) objective, \n",
    "    * (b) “single-barreled, i.e only related to a single asepct of the abstract: E.g. “Does the abstract indicate that particpants were sampled from the general population?”\n",
    "    * (c) use the same sentence structure,\n",
    "    * (d) include yes/no/unsure answers only\n",
    "     \n",

    "    * Screening each article\n",
    "    * Making a decision about whether it should be included\n",
    "    \n",

    "\n",
    "The resulting collection of studies should then be a solid base for future research. An easy way to keep track of the literature in question is to add them to a citation manager such as [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/). A so created Zotero library can be used to create a list of references on the fly, shared online or integrated with a number of other digital tools.

    "\n",
    "Crossreference with the requirements provided in Tip 1. Also evaluate the data format (e.g. the [BIDS]() standard] and check the quality parameters that most platforms include. If a dataset looks fit for your purposes, ivestigate further by downloading samples and implementing your own systematic quality assessment or analyzing the descriptive statistics provided with the dataset. This is not a trivial task so make sure to search for relevant tools and papers on the subject, and consult with your colleagues or advisors.\n",
