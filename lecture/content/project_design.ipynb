    "At the start of each project there should be an initial question. These may appear due to obeservations of our surroundings or e.g. by expanding on already existing literature. The first step of every project should therefore involve turning our observations/thoughts into a well defined research question. Start of by [scouring literature](lit_review) and find out more about the topic. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Following `define your research question` based on:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - what(topic, data modality)? \n",

    "    - why (motivation)?\n",

    "--------------------------------------------\n",

    "### Types of research questions\n",
    "\n",
    "It's further necessary to evaulate if you're questions relates to something quantifiable or if are you more interested in `discovering` or `exploring` the `quality` of a certain phenomenon.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `quantitative research question` can be answered using numerical data and statistical analysis. They generally appear in 3 different forms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- descriptive: describe a phenomenon or group of people in detail (e.g. what is the prevalence of depression in hamsters?)\n",
    "\n",
    "- comparative: compare two or more groups or phenomena (\"What are the differences in academic performance between students from academic and blue collar families?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- `relationship`s: how do changes in one variable affect changes in another (\"What is the relationship between social media use and the prevalence of eating disorders in teenagers?\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "A `qualitative research question` focuses more on exploring and understanding e.g. social phenomena, experiences, and perspectives in-depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "- They may be `open-ended`, allowing the researcher to explore the phenomenon in-depth. For example, \"What factors contribute to the success of mentoring programs in the workplace?\". \n",
    "\n",
    "- They also may `seek to explore exeriences, or perspectives`, e.g. \"What is the experience of living with chronic illness?\" or `seek to explore processes`, such as how something happens or how people make meaning of their experiences, e.g. \"How do parents navigate the challenges of raising a child with autism?\" or \"What are the processes involved in the formation of a group identity among adolescents?\n",
    "\n",
    "- They may further be `concerned with a description/exploration of the nature a specific context`, such as a culture, community, organization, or group of individuals. For example, \"What are the attitudes of young adults towards marriage in a conservative society?\" or \"How do employees experience the culture of a large multinational corporation?\n",

    "\n",
    "- `Which tools` are you going to need (software or hardware e.g. for data collection)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "If you're doing reserach you will necessarily need to learn how to programm, e.g. to organize and clean your data or to do statistical analyses. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make sure that you've got all the prerequisites installed for your respective need it's customary to use a [`package and environment management system`](https://towardsdatascience.com/environment-package-management-55168c56b77). This is commonly done using [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).\n",

    "### Conda \n",
    "\n",
    "Conda is an open-source package and environment management system that simplifies the process of installing, managing, and organizing packages and dependencies. Conda supports a multitude of programming languages such as Python and R.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important functions of Conda is creating and managing isolated environments. An evniroment in this case specifies the specific packages and their versions installed for a speific project. Programming packages are the same as other software such as e.g. `Word` or `Excel`. As every new `Excel` version adds new functionalities or slight changes to how the programm works, so are there changes in the packages of programming languages like `Python`. `Python` uses packages such as `Numpy` for mathematical operations, but with new `Numpy` versions the way certain calculations are done may change, e.g. to make the program more efficient or stable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Should changes like this occur it becomes hard to reproduce the results of earlier research. Therefore `conda` allows us to specify which `packages` and what `version` of these packages was used for a certain project. This information is stored in an `enviornment file`. Other researchers can following use this `enviornment file` to reproduce the exact same `analyses`. Thus making the original `work` reproducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's recommended that one creates a separate environment for each project or application, with its own set of dependencies and packages, so as not to interfere with other environments or the system itself.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "--------------------\n",
