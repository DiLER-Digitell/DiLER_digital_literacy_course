It is of course still possible to simply maintain a word document with all your ideas, notes, citations or i.e code snippets & statistics or to simply store your data and writing in whatever way feels comfortable for you, there have been a number of new tools and standards that will make your life much easier and allow you to be a more organized, more efficient scientist.\n",

The first step of every project should therefore involve turning our observations/thoughts into a well defined research question. Start of by [scouring literature](lit_review) and find out more about the specific topic you're interested in. \n",

    "\n",
    "It's further necessary to evaulate if you're questions relates to something quantifiable or if are you more interested in `discovering` or `exploring` the `quality` of a certain phenomenon.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `quantitative research question` can be answered using numerical data and statistical analysis. They generally appear in 3 different forms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- descriptive: describe a phenomenon or group of people in detail (e.g. what is the prevalence of depression in hamsters?)\n",
    "\n",
    "- comparative: compare two or more groups or phenomena (\"What are the differences in academic performance between students from academic and blue collar families?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- `relationship`s: how do changes in one variable affect changes in another (\"What is the relationship between social media use and the prevalence of eating disorders in teenagers?\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "A `qualitative research question` focuses more on exploring and understanding e.g. social phenomena, experiences, and perspectives in-depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "- They may be `open-ended`, allowing the researcher to explore the phenomenon in-depth. For example, \"What factors contribute to the success of mentoring programs in the workplace?\". \n",
    "\n",
    "- They also may `seek to explore exeriences, or perspectives`, e.g. \"What is the experience of living with chronic illness?\" or `seek to explore processes`, such as how something happens or how people make meaning of their experiences, e.g. \"How do parents navigate the challenges of raising a child with autism?\" or \"What are the processes involved in the formation of a group identity among adolescents?\n",
    "\n",
    "- They may further be `concerned with a description/exploration of the nature a specific context`, such as a culture, community, organization, or group of individuals. For example, \"What are the attitudes of young adults towards marriage in a conservative society?\" or \"How do employees experience the culture of a large multinational corporation?\n",

    "- Which `data modality` is necessary to answer your question, e.g. do i need survey data, reaction times or neuroimaging?\n",
    "\n",
    "- `What needs to be done with the data before you can analyse it?` (i.e. quality control, data preprocessing (cleaning, descriptive statistics etc.))\n",
    "\n",
    "- What `statistical analysis` is necessary to answer my question (E.g. T-test vs. regression models vs. Machine learning etc.)?\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Which tools` are you going to need (software or hardware e.g. for data collection)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "If you're doing reserach you will necessarily need to learn how to programm, e.g. to organize and clean your data or to do statistical analyses. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make sure that you've got all the prerequisites installed for your respective need it's customary to use a [`package and environment management system`](https://towardsdatascience.com/environment-package-management-55168c56b77). This is commonly done using [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conda \n",
    "\n",
    "Conda is an open-source package and environment management system that simplifies the process of installing, managing, and organizing packages and dependencies. Conda supports a multitude of programming languages such as Python and R.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important functions of Conda is creating and managing isolated environments. An evniroment in this case specifies the specific packages and their versions installed for a speific project. Programming packages are the same as other software such as e.g. `Word` or `Excel`. As every new `Excel` version adds new functionalities or slight changes to how the programm works, so are there changes in the packages of programming languages like `Python`. `Python` uses packages such as `Numpy` for mathematical operations, but with new `Numpy` versions the way certain calculations are done may change, e.g. to make the program more efficient or stable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Should changes like this occur it becomes hard to reproduce the results of earlier research. Therefore `conda` allows us to specify which `packages` and what `version` of these packages was used for a certain project. This information is stored in an `enviornment file`. Other researchers can following use this `enviornment file` to reproduce the exact same `analyses`. Thus making the original `work` reproducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's recommended that one creates a separate environment for each project or application, with its own set of dependencies and packages, so as not to interfere with other environments or the system itself.\n",

Remember that **an inidviudal project will surivive longer than the research that is done on it and will (potentially) influence the scientific consensus on a given topic down the line by providing data, insights or new methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "We therfore design our projects to maximize reproducibility, by following the [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/), i.e  by increasing the **F**indability of our work (e.g. via OSF), the **A**ccesebility (of our data and code), the **I**nteroperability of our analyses (via setting up and sharing environment files) and the **R**eusability (e.g. by prociding adequate documentation and description of our datasets and sharing our code via GitHUB).\n",
    "\n",
    "We further learned to organize our project by setting up a Data Management Plan, and how to establish our project on a `local level` (i.e. creating a standardized ofile and data systems), as well as `online` (via `GitHUB`, `Zotero`, `OSF`. Additionally we learned how to `pre-register` studies and why this is a good idea!\n",
