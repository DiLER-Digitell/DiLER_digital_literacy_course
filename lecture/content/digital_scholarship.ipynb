    "Digital scholarship here refers to research practices centered around using digital systems. \n",
    "    \n",
    "Due to the evolution of computers and increasingly faster communication technologies, science has evolved beyond simply collecting data for a specific project, running some (simple) analysis, and publishing results in a Scientific journal. Buzzwords like \"Big Data,\" \"cloud computing,\" and Machine learning/A.I have taken the world, Academia included, by storm. In the following lesson, we'll provide a general introduction regarding relevant concepts and technologies, how and when to apply them, and guide you toward additional resources that may help you evolve these skill sets yourself.\n",

    "## Roadmap\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll mainly concentrate on the trio of **Big Data Analytics, Machine Learning/AI, and Cloud Computing** in the following content blocks. You'll also be more generally introduced to relevant concepts like **Social Media Analytics, Natural Language Processing, Human-Computer Interaction, the Internet of Things (IoT) approach, and Social Media Analytics**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following lessons will mainly consist of introductory chapters to the most important aspects where digital literacy meets modern fields of science.\n",
