    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Academic content can take on many forms besides the classic report or thesis paper, especially now that it's become easier than ever to create an online presence. A community of scientists is switching to creating websites documenting their research endeavors in-depth, often alongside classic journal publications.\n",
    "\n",
    "These \"living publications\" often take the form of an e-book that is freely accessible online. An example of this can be found here in the [publication “Neuroscout: a unified platform for generalizable and reproducible fMRI research”](https://neuroscout.github.io/neuroscout-paper/intro.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the chapter [communication and collaboration](), you'll learn how to create such an online presence. An in-depth introduction to how to create a website using open-source tools can be found in the course [ creating interactive content with “Jupyter Books”!](https://felixkoerber.github.io/jb/intro.html); this template can be simply adapted to host a book or publication.\n",

    "## Creating a Lab-notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying content is often derived from the documentation scientists write alongside their scientific work. A useful tool to take notes and document your work is a so-called \"lab notebook.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Getting into the habit of maintaining a lab notebook is crucial for beginner scientists, regardless of their field of study, but it is also a relevant skill for every professional.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a tool to record all of your observations, measurements, calculations, and ideas related to a scientific experiment or project. A well-kept lab notebook serves as a permanent record of your work and can be a valuable resource for future reference, collaboration, and communication with others. Storing it online, e.g., on a project [repository on GitHub](), allows you to access your notes from anywhere in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your Lab Notebook may be project-specific or kept more in the form of a \"research diary,\" where you jot down what you have been working on throughout a day or week.\n",
    "\n",
    "Content could be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Date and title of the experiment, \n",
    "\n",
    "- project or sub-task that you've been working on\n",
    "\n",
    "- background information, \n",
    "\n",
    "- links or snippets of relevant literature\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code and related bugs you may have encountered, including how you've solved them\n",
    "\n",
    "- Procedure, including step-by-step instructions and any deviations from the plan\n",
    "\n",
    "- Observations, including data and measurements recorded during the experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "- Calculations, including formulas and results\n",
    "\n",
    "- Drawings, Graphs, and visual aids\n",

    "### Maintaining a Lab-notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "How often you update and how extensive your entries are is entirely up to you. A good habit is to take short notes at the end of each workday and translate them into your Lab notebook once a week. This not only helps you keep tabs on the work you've been doing but also helps you think about and engage with your work more deeply. It further provides a handy resource for progress meetings with other students or Professors and P.I.s.\n",

    "### Jupyter Notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "A popular file format for writing a lab notebook and for scientific content creation is the [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/), as it provides a convenient and interactive environment for text content, visualizations, and code snippets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you're taking notes, collecting code snippets in your lab notebook, or writing a report or research paper, Jupyter Notebooks can help you organize and communicate your findings effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "An in-depth lesson on content creation with Jupyter Notebooks can be found in the sub-chapter [Jupyter Notebooks](https://diler-digitell.github.io/DiLER_digital_literacy_course/content/jupyter_notebooks_in_edu.html?highlight=notebook).\n"
