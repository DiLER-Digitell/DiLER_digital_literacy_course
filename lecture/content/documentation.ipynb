    "Academic content can take on many forms beside the classic report or thesis paper, especially now that it's become easier than ever to create an online presence a community of scientists is switching to creating websites documenting their research endeavours in-depth, often alongside classic journal publications.\n",

    "These \"living publications\" often take the form of an e-book that is freely accessible online. An example of this can be found here for the [publication “Neuroscout: a unified platform for generalizable and reproducible fMRI research”](https://neuroscout.github.io/neuroscout-paper/intro.html).\n",

    "In the chapter [communication and collaboration]() you'll learn how to create such an online presence. An in-dept intoduction how to create a website using open-source tools can be found in the course [ creating interactive content with “Jupyter Books”!](https://felixkoerber.github.io/jb/intro.html), this template can be simply adapted to host a book or publication.\n",

A well-kept lab notebook serves as a permanent record of your work and can be a valuable resource for future reference, collaboration, and communication with others. Storing it online, e.g. on a project [repository on GitHub]() allows you to access your notes from anywhere in the world.\n",

This not only helps you keep tabs on the work you've been doing, but also helps you to more deeply think about and engage with your work.
