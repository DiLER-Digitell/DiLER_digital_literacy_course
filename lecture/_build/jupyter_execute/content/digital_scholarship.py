# ### Digital scholarship/academic practice
# 
# ### Introduction
# Digital scholarship here refers to research practices centered around the usage of digital systems. 
#     
# Due to the evolution of computers and increasingly faster communication technologies science has evolved beyond simply collecting data for a specific project, running some (simple) analysis and publishing results in a scientific journal. Buzzwords like "Big Data", "cloud computing" and Machine learning/A.I have taken the world, Academia included, by storm. In the following lesson we'll provide a general introduction regarding relevant concepts and technlogogies, how and when to apply them and guide you towards additional ressources that may help you evolve these skillsets yourself.

# ## Roadmap
# 
# We'll mostly concentrate on the trio of **Big Data Analytics, Machine Learning/AI and Cloud Computing** in the following content blocks. You'll also be more generally introduced about relevant concepts like **Social Media Analytics, Natural Language Processing, Human-Computer Interaction, Internet of Things (IoT) approach and Social Media Analytics**.
