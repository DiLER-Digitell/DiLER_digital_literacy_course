    "### The turing way: Everything you need to know for science communication\n",
    "\n",
    "The go to ressource for modern, digital science communication was created by the [Turing Way project](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome.html).\n",

    "### Publication\n",
    "\n",
    "The main avenue of science communication has always been the journal publication, as this process is complex and time-consuming you'll usually supported by your supervisor or senior lab-members. Therefore we won't get into this process here.\n",
    "\n",
    "A new developmeng in science communication is the so called preprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "A preprint is an early version of a scientific manuscript that is made publicly available online prior to formal peer review and publication in a journal. The main benefits of preprints are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Faster dissemination of research findings`: Preprints allow researchers to make their work public as soon as it is ready, allowing other researchers and the general public to access and build upon their findings more quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Improved visibility and impact`: Preprints increase the visibility of research by making it more discoverable online, which can lead to greater impact and more citations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Enhanced collaboration and feedback`: Preprints provide researchers with an opportunity to receive early feedback from the community and collaborate with other researchers, leading to improved research quality and productivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common platforms for publishing preprints in the field of scientific research are:\n",
    "\n",
    "   -  [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/): A popular platform for preprints in physics, mathematics, computer science, and other related fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/): A platform for preprints in the life sciences and biology.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - [SocArXiv](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv): A platform for preprints in the social sciences.\n",

    "#### Creating an open & reproducible publication from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the things we've discussed here are further implemented in the in-depth guide on how to create an open and reproducable publication in the field of neuroimaging. If you're interested in building a portfolio and doing open research, follow this guide:\n",

    "### Building your personal website\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reseacher it is essential to connect with others, it is therefore sensible to manage your online presence by creating a personal website to communicate your work, how you can be reached etc. This can also be used as your personal blog, which is a great starting point to level up your writing skills and learn how to think, write and communicate your ideas more clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- can be achieved via github pages\n",
