# 
# **Artificial intelligence (AI)** is [intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence) demonstrated by [machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine), as opposed to the natural intelligence [displayed by humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_intelligence) or [animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_cognition). Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of ["intelligent agents"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent): any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals. Some popular accounts use the term "artificial intelligence" to describe machines that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the [human mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mind), such as "learning" and "problem solving", however this definition is rejected by major AI researchers.

# 
# **Machine learning (ML)** is the study of computer [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. It is seen as a part of [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence). Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as ["training data"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_data), in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. A subset of machine learning is closely related to [computational statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_statistics), which focuses on making predictions using computers; but not all machine learning is statistical learning. The study of [mathematical optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization) delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning. [Data mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining) is a related field of study, focusing on [exploratory data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis) through [unsupervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning). Some implementations of machine learning use data and [neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_networks) in a way that mimics the working of a biological brain.

# 
# **Deep learning** (also known as deep structured learning) is part of a broader family of [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) methods based on [artificial neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_networks) with [representation learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_learning). Learning can be [supervised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning), [semi-supervised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-supervised_learning) or [unsupervised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning). [Artificial neural networks (ANNs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) were inspired by information processing and distributed communication nodes in [biological systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_system). ANNs have various differences from biological [brains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain). Specifically, neural networks tend to be static and symbolic, while the biological brain of most living organisms is dynamic (plastic) and analogue. The adjective "deep" in deep learning refers to the use of multiple layers in the network. Early work showed that a linear [perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron) cannot be a universal classifier, but that a network with a nonpolynomial activation function with one hidden layer of unbounded width can.

# 

# - very important: **deep learning is machine learning**
#     - DL is a specific subset of ML
#     - structured vs. unstructured input
#     - linearity
#     - model architectures
# 

# - you and "the machine"
#     - ML models can become better at a specific task, however they need some form of guidance
#     - DL models in contrast require less human intervention

# - Why the buzz? 
# 
#     - works amazing on structured input
#     - highly flexible ‚Üí universal function approximator 

# - What are the challenges?
# 
#     - large number of parameters ‚Üí data hungry 
#     - large number of hyper-parameters ‚Üí difficult to train

# - When do I use it?
# 
#     - if you have highly-structured input, eg. medical images. 
#     - you have a lot of data and computational resources.

# Why go `deep learning` in `neuroscience`? (all highly discussed)

# - complexity of biological systems
#     - integrate knowledge of biological systems in computational systems
#       (excitation vs. inhibition, normalization, LIF)
#     - linear-nonlinear processing
#     - utilize computational systems as `model systems`

# Why go `deep learning` in `neuroscience`? (all highly discussed)
# 
# - limitations of "simple models"
#     - fail to capture diversity of biological systems
#       (response heterogeneity, sensitivity vs. specificity, etc.)
#     - fail to perform as good as biological systems

# Why go `deep learning` in `neuroscience`? (all highly discussed)
# 
# - addressing the "why question"
#     - why do biological systems work in the way they do
#     - insights into objectives and constraints defined by evolutionary pressure

# ### Deep learning - basics & reasoning
# 
# - as said before: `deep learning` is (a subset of) `machine learning` 
# - it thus includes the core aspects we talked about in the [previous section]() and builds upon them:
#     - different learning problems and resulting models/architectures
#     - loss function & optimization
#     - training, evaluation, validation
#     - biases & problems

# - this furthermore transfers to the key components you as a user has to think about
#     - objective function (What is the goal?)
#     - learning rule (How should weights be updated to improve the objective function?)
#     - network architecture (What are the network parts and how are they connected?)
#     - initialisation (How are weights initially defined?)
#     - environment (What kind of data is provided for/during the learning?)

# ##### Learning problems
# 
# As in [machine learning]() in general, we have `supervised` & `unsupervised learning problems` again:
# 
# <img align="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeerHerholz/ML-DL_workshop_SynAGE/master/lecture/static/supervised_unsupervised.png" alt="logo" title="Github" width="1200" height="350" />

# However, within the world of `deep learning`, we have three more `learning problems`:
# 
# - [reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning)
# 
# <img align="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeerHerholz/ML-DL_workshop_SynAGE/master/lecture/static/RL.png" alt="logo" title="Github" width="600" height="350" />

# - [semi-supervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-supervised_learning)
# 
# <img align="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeerHerholz/ML-DL_workshop_SynAGE/master/lecture/static/semisupervised.png" alt="logo" title="Github" width="600" height="350" />

# - [self-supervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-supervised_learning)
# 
# <img align="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeerHerholz/ML-DL_workshop_SynAGE/master/lecture/static/self-supervised.png" alt="logo" title="Github" width="600" height="350" />

# - depending on the data and task, these `learning problems` can be employed within a diverse set of [artificial neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) architectures (most commonly):
#     - [Multilayer perceptrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron)
#     - [Convolutional neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network)
#     - [Recurrent neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network)    

# But why employ [artificial neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) at all?

# ##### The problem of variance & how representations can help
# 
# Think about all the things you as an `biological agent` do on a typical day ... Everything (most things) you do appear very easy to you. Then why is so hard for `artificial agents` to achieve a comparable `behavior` and/or `performance`?

# One major problem is the `variance` of the input we encounter which subsequently makes it very hard to find appropriate `transformations` that can lead to/help to achieve `generalizable behavior`. 

# How about an example? We'll keep it very simple and focus on `recognizing` a certain `category` of the natural world.

# You all waited for it and now it's finally happening: cute cats! 

# - let's assume we want to learn to recognize, label and predict "cats" based on a set of images that look like this
# 
# <img align="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeerHerholz/ML-DL_workshop_SynAGE/master/lecture/static/cat_prototype.png" alt="logo" title="Github" width="150" height="250" />

# - utilizing the `models` and `approaches` we talked about so far, we would use `predetermined transformations` (`features`) of our data `X`:
# 
# <img align="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeerHerholz/ML-DL_workshop_SynAGE/master/lecture/static/cat_ml.png" alt="logo" title="Github" width="600" height="280" />

# - this constitutes a form of [inductive bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_bias), i.e. `assumptions` we include in the `learning problem` and thus back into the respective `models`

# - however, this is by far not the only way we could encounter a cat ... there are a lots of sources of variation of our data `X`, including:

# - illumination
# 
# <img align="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeerHerholz/ML-DL_workshop_SynAGE/master/lecture/static/cat_illumination.png" alt="logo" title="Github" width="400" height="250" />

# - deformation
# 
# <img align="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeerHerholz/ML-DL_workshop_SynAGE/master/lecture/static/cat_deformation.png" alt="logo" title="Github" width="600" height="350" />

# - occlusion
# 
# <img align="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeerHerholz/ML-DL_workshop_SynAGE/master/lecture/static/cat_occlusion.png" alt="logo" title="Github" width="600" height="350" />

# - background clutter
# 
# <img align="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeerHerholz/ML-DL_workshop_SynAGE/master/lecture/static/cat_background.png" alt="logo" title="Github" width="600" height="350" />

# - and intraclass variation
# 
# <img align="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeerHerholz/ML-DL_workshop_SynAGE/master/lecture/static/cat_variation.png" alt="logo" title="Github" width="600" height="350" />

# - these variations (and many more) are usually not accounted for and our mapping from `X` to `Y` would fail

# - what we want to learn to prevent this are `invariant representations` that capture `latent variables` which are variables you (most likely) cannot directly observe, but that affect the variables you can observe 

# <img align="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeerHerholz/ML-DL_workshop_SynAGE/master/lecture/static/cat_dl.png" alt="logo" title="Github" width="600" height="350" />

# - the "simple models" we talked about so far work with `predetermined transformations` and thus perform `shallow learning`, more "complex models" perform `deep learning` in their `hidden layers` to learn `representations`

# <img align="center" src="https://media1.giphy.com/media/26ufdipQqU2lhNA4g/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47wv88pqvnas5utdrw2qap9xn9lmjvwv4kn3qenjr9&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g" alt="logo" title="Github" width="300" height="300" />

# </sup></sup></sub></sup></sub>

# But how?

# One important aspect to discuss here is another `inductive bias` we put into `models` (think about the `AI` set again) : the `hierarchical perception` of the `natural world`. In other words: the world around is `compositional` which means that the things we perceive are composed of smaller pieces, which themselves are composed of smaller pieces and so on ... .

# As something we can also observe as an `organizational principle` in `biological brains` (the `hierarchical organization` of the `visual` and `auditory cortex` for example) this is something that tremendously informed `deep learning`, especially certain `architectures`.

# The question is still: how do `ANN`s do that?

# ### From biological to artificial neural neurons and networks
# 
# - decades ago researchers started to create artificial neurons to tackle tasks "conventional algorithms" couldn't handle
# - inspired by the learning and performance of biological neurons and networks
# - mimic defining aspects of biological neurons and networks 
# - examples are: [integrate and fire neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_neuron_model#Leaky_integrate-and-fire), [rectified linear rate neuron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)), [perceptrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron), [multilayer perceptrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron), [convolutional neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network), [recurrent neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network), [autoencoders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoencoder), [generative adversarial networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network)

# - using biological neurons and networks as the basis for artificial neurons and networks might therefore also help to learn `invariant representations` that capture `latent variables`
# - `deep learning` = `representation learning`
# - our minds (most likely) contains `(invariant) representations` about the world that allow us to interact with it
#     - `task optimization`
#     - `generalizability` 

# Back to biology...
# 
# - `neurons` receive one or more inputs
#     - [excitatory postsynaptic potentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excitatory_postsynaptic_potential)
#     - [inhibitory postsynaptic potentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential)
# -  inputs are summed up to produce an output
#     - an activation
# - inputs are separably [weighted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighting) and sum passed through a [non-linear function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-linear_function)
#     - [activation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_function) or [transfer function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_function)
# 
# <img align="right" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Neuron3.svg/2560px-Neuron3.svg.png" alt="logo" title="Github" width="300" height="300" />

# - these processes can be translated into mathematical problems including the input `X`, its weights `W` and the activation function `f`

# - the thing about `activation function`s...
# 
#     - they define the resulting type of an `artificial neuron`
#     - thus they also define its capabilities
#     - require non-linearity
#         - because otherwise only linear functions and decision probabilities

# - historically either [sigmoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function) or [tanh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_function#Hyperbolic_tangent) utilized
# - even though they are [non-linear functions]() their properties make them insufficient for most problems, especially `sigmoid`
#     - rather simple `polynomials`  
#     - mainly work for `binary problems`
#     - computationally expensive
#     - they saturate causing the neuron and thus network to "die", i.e. stop `learning`
# - modern `ANN` frequently use `continuous activation functions` like [Rectified Linear Unit](https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/rectified-linear-units)
#     - doesn't saturate
#     - faster training and convergence
#     - introduce network sparsity

# Still, the question is: how does this help us?

# Let's imagine the following situation:
# 
# <img align="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeerHerholz/ML-DL_workshop_SynAGE/master/lecture/static/UAT_problem.png" alt="logo" title="Github" width="600" height="350" />
# 
# - we could try to iterate over all possible `transformations`/`functions` necessary to enable and/or optimize the `output`

# However, we could also introduce a [hidden layer]() that learns or more precisely `approximates` what those `transformations`/`functions` are on its own:
# 
# <img align="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeerHerholz/ML-DL_workshop_SynAGE/master/lecture/static/UAT_hiddenlayer.png" alt="logo" title="Github" width="600" height="350" />
# 

# The idea: there is a `neural network` so that for every possible input `X`, the outcome is `f(X)`.

# Importantly, the [hidden layer]() consists of [artificial neurons]() that perceive `weighted inputs` `w` and perform [non-linear]() ([non-saturating]()) [activation functions]() `v` which `output` will be used for the `task` at hand
# 
# <img align="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeerHerholz/ML-DL_workshop_SynAGE/master/lecture/static/UAT_hiddenlayer_function.png" alt="logo" title="Github" width="600" height="350" />
# 

# It gets even better: this holds true even if there are multiple `inputs` and `outputs`:
# 
# <img align="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeerHerholz/ML-DL_workshop_SynAGE/master/lecture/static/UAT_generalizability.png" alt="logo" title="Github" width="600" height="350" />
# 

# - this is referred to as `universality` and finally brings us to one core aspect of `deep learning`

# ##### Universal function approximation theorem
# 
# - `artificial neural networks` are considered `universal function approximators`
#     - the possibility of `approximating` a(ny) `function` to some accuracy with  
#       (a set of) [artificial neurons]() in [hidden layer](s)
#     - instead of providing a predetermined set of `transformations` or `functions`,
#       the `ANN` learns/approximates them by itself

# -  two problems:
#     - the theorem doesn't tell us how many [artificial neurons we need]()
#     - either arbitrary number of artificial neurons ("arbitrary width" case) or
#       arbitrary number of hidden layers, each containing a limited number of artificial neurons ("arbitrary depth" 
#       case)

# - going back to "shallow learning": we provide pre-extracted/pre-computed `features` of our `data` `X` and maybe apply further `preprocessing` before letting our model `M` `learns` the mapping to our outcome `Y` via `optimization` (minimizing the `loss function`) 
# 
# <img align="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeerHerholz/ML-DL_workshop_SynAGE/master/lecture/static/core_aspects_preprocessing.png" alt="logo" title="Github" width="500" height="280" />

# - as it's very cumbersome to nearly impossible to iterate over all possible `features`, `functions` and `parameters` what `deep learning` does instead is to `learn` `features` by itself, namely those that are most useful for the `objective function`, e.g. `minimize loss` for a given `task` as defined by `optimization`

# To bring the things we talked about so far together, we will focus on `ANN` components and how `learning` takes place next...but at first, let's take a breather.

# #### Components of `ANN`s
# 
# - now that we've spent quite some time on the `neurobiological informed` underpinnings it's time to put the respective pieces together and see how they are actually employed within `ANN`s  
# - for this we will talk about two aspects:
#     - building blocks of `ANN`s
#     - learning in `ANN`s

# ##### Building blocks of `ANN`s

# - having talked about `overt building blocks` of `ANN`s we need to talk about `building blocks` that are rather `covert`, that is the aspects that define how `ANN`s learn...

# ##### Learning in `ANN`s
# 
# - let's go back a few hours and talk about `model fitting` again

# - when talking about `model fitting`, we need to talk about three central aspects:
#     - the `model`
#     - the `loss function`
#     - the `optimization`

# | Term         | Definition | 
# |--------------|:-----:|
# | Model |  A set of parameters that makes a prediction based on a given input. The parameter values are fitted to available data.|
# | Loss function | A function that evaluates how well your algorithm models your dataset |
# | Optimization | A function that tries to minimize the loss via updating model parameters. |
# 	

# #### An example: linear regression
# 
# - Model:  $$y=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1} x_{1}^{2}+\beta_{2} x_{2}^{2}$$
# - Loss function: $$ M S E=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(y_{i}-\hat{y}_{i}\right)^{2}$$
# - optimization: [Gradient descent]()
# 

# - `Gradient descent` with a `single input variable` and `n samples`
#     - Start with random weights (`Œ≤0` and `Œ≤1`) $$\hat{y}_{i}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1} X_{i}$$
#     - Compute loss (i.e. `MSE`) $$M S E=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(y_{i}-\hat{y}_{i}\right)^{2}$$
#     - Update `weights` based on the `gradient`

# - to sufficiently talk about `learning` in `ANN`s we need to add a few things, however we heard some of them already 
#     - `metric`
#     - `activation function`
#     - `weights`
#     - `batch size`
#     - `gradient descent`
#     - `backpropagation`
#     - `epoch`
#     - `regularization`
#     

# - as you can see, this is going to be something else but we will be trying to bring everything together for a holistic overview

# Remember how we talked about the different `learning problems`? As noted before, the initial idea of `deep learning`/`AI` was rather centered around `unsupervised` or `self-supervised learning problems`. However, based on the limited success of corresponding `models` and the outstanding performance of `supervised models`, the latter where way more heavily applied and focused on. Unfortunately, this workshop won't be an exception to that. First of all given time and computational resources and second because we though it might be easier to go through the above mentioned things based on a `supervised learning problem`. If you disagree, please let us know! We will however go through some other `learning problems` later, e.g. when checking out different `architectures` and (hopefully) during the practical session where we'll evaluate what's possible with your `datasets`! 

# For now, we will keep it rather simple and bring back our `cats`, assuming we want to `train` the example `ANN` of the `building blocks part` to recognize and distinguish them from other animals. To keep it neuroscience related in our minds we could also assume it's about different `brain tissue classes`, `cell types`, etc. .

# 
# Our `ANN` receives an input, here an `image`, and should conduct a certain task, here recognizing/predicting the `animal` that is shown.

# **Initialization of `weights` & `biases`**
# 
# Upon `building` our network we also need to `initialize` the `weights` and `biases`. Both are important `hyper-parameters` for our `ANN` and the way it `learns` as they can help preventing `activation function outputs` from `exploding` or `vanishing` when moving through the `ANN`. This relates directly to the `optimization` as the `loss gradient` might become too large or too small, prolonging the time the network needs to converge or even prevents it completely. Importantly, certain `initializers` work better with certain `activation functions`. For example: [tanh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_functions#Hyperbolic_tangent) likes `Glorot/Xavier initialization` while [ReLu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)) likes `He initialization`.

# **The input layer & the [semantic gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_gap)**
# 
# One thing we need to talk about is what the `ANN`, or more precisely the `input layer`, actually receives... 
# The same thing, that is the picture of the cat, is very different for us than for a computer. This is referred to as the [semantic gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_gap): the `transformation` of human actions & percepts into `computational representations`. This picture of a majestic cat is nothing but a huge `array` for the computer and also what will be submitted to the `input layer` of the `ANN` (note: this also holds true for basically any other type of data). 

# It thus important to synchronize the `dimensions` of the input and the `input shape/size` of the `input layer`. This will also define the `datasets` you can `train` and `test` an `ANN` on. For example, if you want to work with `MRI volumes` that have the dimensions `[40, 56, 50]` or `microscopy images` with `[300, 200, 3]`, your `input layer` should have the same `input shape/size`. The same holds true for all other data you want to `train` and `test` your `ANN` on. Otherwise you would need to redefine the `input layer`.

# <img align="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeerHerholz/ML-DL_workshop_SynAGE/master/lecture/static/ANN_cat_input.png" alt="logo" title="Github" width="700" height="450" />
# 
# Please note that our example is therefore `drastically over-simplified` as we would need waaaay more `nodes` or could just `input` 2 values.

# **A journey through the `ANN`**
# 
# The input is then processed by the `layers`, their `nodes` and respective `activation functions`, being passed through the `ANN`. Each `layer` and `node` will compute a certain `transformation` of the `input` it receives from the previous `layer` based on its `activation function` and `weights`/`biases`.

# **The `output layer`**
# 
# After a while, we will reach the end of our `ANN`, the `output layer`. As the last part of our `ANN`, it will produce the results we're interested in. Its number of `nodes` and `activation function` will depend on the `learning problem` at hand. For a `binary classification task` it will have `2 nodes` corresponding to the both `classes` and might use `sigmoid` or [softmax activation function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function). For `multiclass classification tasks` it will have as many `nodes` as there are `classes` and utilize the [softmax activation function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function). Both `sigmoid` and `softmax` are related to `logistic regression`, with the latter being a generalized form of it. Why does this matter? Our `output layer` will produce `real-valued scores` for each of the `classes` that are however not `scaled` and straightforward to interpret. Using for example the `softmax function` we can transform these values into `scaled probability distributions` between `0` and `1` which values add up to `1` and can be submitted to other analysis pipelines or directly evaluated. 

# Lets assume our `ANN` is `trained` to recognize and distinguish `cats` and `capybaras`, meaning we have a `binary classification task`.  Defining `cats` as `class 1` and `capybaras` as `class 2` (not my opinion, just an example), the corresponding `vectors` we would like to obtain from the `output layer` would be `[1,0]` and `[0,1]` respectively. However, what we would get from the `output layer` in absence of e.g. `softmax`, would rather look like `[1.6, 0.2]` and `[0.4, 1.2]`. This is identical to what the penultimate `layer` would provide as `input` the `output` i.e. `softmax layer` if we had an additional layer just for that and not the respective `activation function`. 

# After passing through the `softmax layer` or our `output layer` with `softmax activation function` the `real-valued scores` `[1.6, 0.2]` and `[0.4, 1.2]` would be (for example) `[0.802, 0.198]` and `[0.310, 0.699]`. Knowing it's now a `scaled probabilistic distribution` that can range between `0` and `1` and sums up to `1`, it's much easier to interpret.

# **The `metric`**
# 
# The index of the vector provided by the `softmax output layer` with the largest value will be treated as the `class` predicted by the `ANN`, which in our example would be "cat". The `ANN` will then use the `predicted class` and compare it to the `true class`, computing a `metric` to assess its performance. Remember folks: `deep learning` is `machine learning` and computing a `metric` is no exception to that. Thus, depending on your data and `learning problem` you can indicate a variety of `metrics` your `ANN` should utilize, including `accuracy`,  `F1`, `AUC`, etc. . Note: in `binary tasks` usually only the largest value is treated as a `class prediction`, this is called `Top-1 accuracy`. On the contrary, in `multiclass tasks` with many `classes` (animals, cell components, disease propagation types, etc.) quite often the largest `5` values are treated as `class predictions` and utilized within the `metric`, which is called `Top-5 accuracy`.

# **The `loss function`**
# 
# Besides the `metric`, our `ANN` will also a compute a `loss function` that will quantify how far the `probabilities`, computed by the `softmax function` of the `output layer`, are away from the `true values` we want to achieve, i.e. the `classes`. As mentioned in the [introduction]() and comparable to the `metric`, the choice of `loss function` depends on the data you have and the `learning problem` you want to solve. If you want to `predict` `numerical values` you might want to employ a `regression` based approach and use `MSE` as the `loss function`. If you want to `predict` `classes` you might to employ a `classification` based approach and use a form of `cross-entropy` as the `loss function`.

# A cool thing about `softmax` with regard to the `loss function`: it is a `continuously differentiable function` and thus the `derivative` of the `loss function` can be computed for every `weight` and every `input` in the `training set`. Based on that the `weights` of the `ANN` can be adapted to reduce the `loss function`, making the `predicted values` provided by the `output layer` closer to the `true values` (i.e. `classes`) and therefore improving the `metric` and performance of the `ANN`. This reducing of the `error` (assessed through the `loss function`) is called the `objective function` of an `ANN`, while the adaptation of `weights` to improve the performance of an `ANN` is the `learning process`. But how does this work now? We know it has something to do with `optimization`...Let's have a look when and how this factors in. 

# **`Batch size`**
# 
# As with other `machine learning` approaches, we will ideally have a `training`, `validation` and `test set`. One `hyperparameter` that is involved in this process and also can define our entire `learning process` is `batch size`. It defines the number of `samples` in the `training set` our `ANN` processes before `optimization` is used to update the `weights` based on the result of the `loss function`. For example, if our `training set` has `100 samples` and we set a `batch size` of `5`, we would divide the `training set` into `20 batches` of `5 samples` each. In turn this would mean that our `ANN` goes through `5 samples` before using `optimization` to update the `weights` and thus our `ANN` would update its `weights` `20` times during `training`.
# 
# 
# <img align="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeerHerholz/ML-DL_workshop_SynAGE/master/lecture/static/ANN_cat_batch.png" alt="logo" title="Github" width="700" height="450" />
# 

# **The `optimization`**
# 
# Once a `batch` has been processed by the `ANN` the `optimization algorithm` will get to work. As mentioned before, most `machine learning problems` utilize [gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent) as the `optimization algorithm`. As mentioned during the [introduction]() and a few slides above, we have an `objective function` we want to `optimize`, for example `minimizing` the `error` computed by our `cross-entropy loss function`.  So what happens is the following. At first, an entire `batch` is processed by the `ANN` and `accuracy` as well as `loss` are computed. 
# 
# <img align="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeerHerholz/ML-DL_workshop_SynAGE/master/lecture/static/ANN_cat_gd.png" alt="logo" title="Github" width="700" height="450" />
# 

# Subsequently, the `error` computed via the `loss function` will be minimized through `gradient descent`. Let's imagine the following: we span a valley-looking like `gradient` that is defined by our `weights` and `biases` on the `horizontal` or `x` and `y` axes and the `loss function` on the `vertical` or `z` axis. This is where our `weight` and `bias initializers` come back: we `initialized` `weights` and `biases` at a certain point on the `gradient`, usually on the top or quite high. Now our `optimization algorithm` takes one step after another (after each `batch`) in the steepest downwards direction along the `gradient` via finding `weights` and `biases` that reduce the `loss` until it reaches the point where the `error` computed by the `loss function` is as small as possible. It is `descending` through the `gradient`. When it reaches this point, i.e. the `error` can't be reduced anymore and remains stable, it has `converged`.

# What this shows nicely is one aspect we briefly discussed during the `introduction`: `ANN`s are complex `models` and result in `non-convex loss functions`, i.e. `gradients` with a `global minimum/maximum` and various `local` ones.
# 
# <img align="center" src="https://blog.paperspace.com/content/images/size/w1050/2018/05/convex_cost_function.jpg" alt="logo" title="Github" width="600" height="400" />
# 
# <sub><sup><sub><sup><sup>https://blog.paperspace.com/content/images/size/w1050/2018/05/convex_cost_function.jpg
# </sup></sup></sub></sup></sub>

# So chances are, our `gradient descent` will get stuck in a `local minimum` and won't find the `global minimum`. At least that's what people thought in the beginning....

# As it turned out, `gradient desecent` rather gets stuck in what is called `saddle points`
# 
# 
# <img align="center" src="https://www.offconvex.org/assets/saddle/minmaxsaddle.png" alt="logo" title="Github" width="600" height="400" />
# 
# <sub><sup><sub><sup><sup>https://www.offconvex.org/assets/saddle/minmaxsaddle.png
# </sup></sup></sub></sup></sub>
# 

# The thing is: in order to find a `local` or `global minimum` all the `dimensions`, i.e. `parameters`(`weights`/`biases`) must agree to this point. However, what happens mostly in `complex models` with millions of `parameters` is that only a subset of `dimensions` agree which creates `saddle points`. 

# There are however newer algorithms that help `gradient descent` getting out of `saddle points`, for example [adam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent#Adam).

# This brings us to some other important aspects of `gradient descent`:
# 
# - types
# - learning rate

# In general, `gradient descent` is divided into three `types`:
# 
# - `batch gradient descent`
# - `stochastic gradient descent`
# - `mini batch gradient descent`

# In `batch gradient descent` the `error` is computed for each `sample` of the `training set`, but `model` will only be updated once the entire `training set` was processed.
# 
# <img align="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeerHerholz/ML-DL_workshop_SynAGE/master/lecture/static/ANN_cat_gd_batch.png" alt="logo" title="Github" width="700" height="450" />
# 

# In `stochastic gradient descent` the `error` is computed for each `sample`of the `training set` and `model` immediately updated. 
# 
# <img align="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeerHerholz/ML-DL_workshop_SynAGE/master/lecture/static/ANN_cat_gd_sgd.png" alt="logo" title="Github" width="700" height="450" />
# 

# In `mini-batch gradient descent` the `error` is computed for a `subset` of the `training set` and the `model` updated after each of those `batches`. It is commonly used, as it combines the `robustness` of `stochastic gradient descent` and the `efficiency` of `batch gradient descent`.
#

# 

# Another important aspect of `gradient descent` is the `learning rate` which describes how big the `steps` are the `gradient descent` takes towards the `minimum`. If the `learning rate` is too high, i.e. the `steps` too big it might bounce back and forth without being able to find the `minimum`. If the `learning rate` is too small, i.e. the `steps` too small it might take a very long time to find the `minimum`.

# 

# Now that we spend some time on `gradient descent` as an `optimization algorithm`, there's still the question how the `parameters`, `weights` and `biases`, of our `ANN` are actually updated.

# **`Backpropagation`**
# 
# Actually, `gradient descent` is part of something bigger called [backpropagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation). Once we did a `forward pass` through the `ANN`, i.e. `data` goes from `input` to `output layer`, the `ANN` will use `backpropagation` to update the `model parameters`. It does so by utilizing `gradient descent` and the [chain rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule) to `propagate` the `error` `backwards`. Simply put: starting at the `output layer` `gradient descent` is applied to `update` its `parameters`, i.e. `weights` and `biases`, the `error` is re-computed through the `loss function` and `propagated backwards` to the previous `layer`, where `parameters` will be `updated`, the `error` re-computed through the `loss function` and so forth. As `parameters` interact with each other, the application of the `chain rule` is important as it can decompose the `composition` of two `differentiable functions` into their `derivatives`.

# 

# We almost have everything together...almost. One thing we still haven't talked about is how long this entire composition of processes will run. 

# **The number of `epochs`**
# 
# The duration of the `ANN` `training` is usually determined by the interplay between `batch sizes` and another `hyperparameter` called `epochs`. Whereas the `batch size` defines the number of `training set samples` to process before updating the `model parameters`, the number of `epochs` specifies how often the `ANN` should process the entire `training set`. Thus, once all `batches` have been processed, one `epoch` is over. The number of `epochs` is something you set when start the `training`, just like the `batch size`. Both are therefore `parameters` for the `training` and not `parameters` that are learned by the `training`. For example, if you have `100 samples`, a `batch size` of `10` and set the number of `epochs` to `500` your `ANN` will go through the entire `training set` `500` times, that is `5000 batches` and thus `5000 updates` to your `model`. While this sounds already like a lot, these numbers are more than small compared to that what "real-life" `ANN`s go through. There, these numbers are in the millions and beyond.

# 
# 
# Please note: this is of course only the theoretical duration in terms of `iterations` and not the actual duration it takes to `train` your `ANN`. This is quite often hard to `predict` (hehe, got it?) as it depends on the `computational setup` you're working with, the `data` and obviously the `model` and its `hyperparameters`.

# **The `regularitzation`**
# 
# Does this ring a bell? That's right: it's still `machine learning` and thus, as with every model, we need to address `overfitting` and `underfitting`, especially with this amount of `parameters`.

# There are actually multiple types of `regularization` we can apply to help our `ANN` to generalize better (other than increasing the size of the `training set`):
# 
# - [L1/L2 regularization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_%28mathematics%29)
# - [dropout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilution_(neural_networks))
# - [data augmentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_augmentation)
# - [early stopping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_stopping)

# Using `L1/L2 regularization` (the most common type of `regularization`), we add a `regularization term` (`L1` or `L2`) to our `loss function` that will decrease the `weights` assuming that `models` with `smaller weights` will lead to less complex `models` that in turn `generalize` better.

# Using `dropout`, we `regularize` by `randomly` and `temporally` dropping `nodes` and their corresponding `connections`, thus efficiently changing the `ANN` `architecture` and introducing a certain amount of `randomness`. (Does this `regularization approach` remind you of one of the `models` we saw during the "classic" `machine learning` part?).

# Using `data augmentation`, we `regularize` without directly changing parts of the `ANN` but changing the `training set`. To be more precise, not really "changing the `training set`" but adding "changed" versions of the `training set samples`, i.e. the same `samples` but in an altered form. For example, if we work with `images` (`MRI volumes`, `microscopy`, etc.) we could shear, shift, scale and rotate the `images`, as well as adding `noise`, etc. . (Think about `invariant representations` again.)

# When using `early stopping` we `regularize` by stopping the `training` before the `ANN` can start to `overfit` on the `training set`, for example if the `validation error` stops decreasing.

# ### ANN architectures
# 
# - now that we've gone through the underlying basics and important building blocks of `ANN`s, we will check out a few of the most commonly used architectures
# - in general we can [group `ANN`s based on their `architecture`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_artificial_neural_networks), that is how their building blocks are defined and integrated
# 

# - possible `architectures` include (only a very tiny subset listed):
#     - [feedforward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_artificial_neural_networks#Feedforward) (information moves in a forward fashion through the ANN, without cycles and/or loops)
#         - [Multilayer perceptrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron)
#         - [Convolutional neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network)
#         - [autoencoders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoencoder)
#     - [recurrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_artificial_neural_networks#Recurrent_neural_network) (information moves in a forward and a backward fashion through the ANN)
#         - [fully recurrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_artificial_neural_networks#Fully_recurrent)
#         - [Long short-term memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_artificial_neural_networks#Long_short-term_memory)
#     - [radial basis function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_artificial_neural_networks#Radial_basis_function_(RBF)) (networks that use radial basis functions as activation function)
#         - [General regression network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_artificial_neural_networks#General_regression_neural_network)
#         - [Deep belief networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_artificial_neural_networks#Deep_belief_network)

# - we will spend a closer look at `feedforward` and `recurrent architectures` as they will (most likely) be the ones you see frequently utilized within `neuroscience` 

# - however, to see how well we explained things to you (and because we're lazy): we would like to ask y'all to form `5` groups and each group will get `5 min` to find something out about `1 ANN architecture` 

# - after that, we will of course also add respective slides to this section!

# ### The moral of the story
# 
# We heard, saw and learned that `deep learning` can be and already is _very_ powerful but ...

# Yes, it's super cool. Yes, it's basically THE BUZZWORD. However, before applying `deep learning` you should ask yourself:
# 
# - does my `task` involve a `hierarchy`?
# - what `computational` and `time resources` do I have?
# - is there enough `data`?
# - are there `pre-trained models`?
# - are there `datasets` I could `pre-train` my `model` on?
# 
# (This slide and all that follow stolen from Blake Richards)

# Quite often, `deep learning` won't be the answer...!
# 
# - a highly recommended read:

# When to use `deep learning`:
# 
# 
# - it is powerful but intended for the `AI set`, `tasks` humans and animals are good at
# - it uses an `inductive bias of hierarchy`, which can be really useful or not at all
# - effective when you have a huge `model` and a huge amount of `data`

# When _not_ to use `deep learning`:
# 
# - no reason to assume the `problem` contains a `hierarchical solution`
# - limited `time` & `computational resources`
# - you only have a small amount of `data` and no related `dataset` to `pre-train`

# If you don't really know or can't really estimate, it's usually a good idea to stick with other, simpler `models` as it's better to stay as `general purpose` as possible in these cases.
