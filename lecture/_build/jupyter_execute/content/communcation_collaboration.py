# ### Where are we now?
# 
# Before we start a lesson it is usually helpful to reflect on what we already know about a certain topic or e.g. what a lesson may possibly try to teach us.
# 
# So please take a few minutes to reflect on the concept of digital literacy with the following questions.
# 
# 
# **1.1**
# 
# 
# ```{note}
# Feel free to do this in your head or in a separate document. Remember, to interactively engage with the material either open it in MyBinder (the small rocket button at the top of the website) or [download the course material](link to course zip), go through the [setup process](link to setup) and open this file (i.e digital_literacy.ipynb in the introduction folder) using Jupyter Notebooks or VScode.
# ```
